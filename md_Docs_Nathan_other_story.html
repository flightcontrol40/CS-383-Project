<div class="textblock"><p>In a land not far from the grasp of human hands, nestled in fertile fields and golden pastures, there existed a proud nation—Bovinia, home to the cows. For generations, they roamed freely, believing their land was sacred, blessed by the Great Hoof, the ancient deity said to have shaped the world with its divine stomps. They lived in harmony, strong in their faith and united in their cause to protect the land entrusted to them by the heavens.</p>
<p>But darkness lurked beyond their peaceful plains.</p>
<p>Word spread from the edge of the human cities—whispers of slaughterhouses, of factories where their kin were taken to be sacrificed on the altar of consumption, butchered and ground into hamburgers to satisfy the endless hunger of humans. The holy fields of Bovinia had been desecrated, and the sacred blood of their kind was being spilled by those who cared nothing for the sanctity of their race.</p>
<p>The Order of the Sacred Udder, a group of warrior-priests sworn to protect their people, convened under the shadow of Cuddome, their holiest city. The Grand Abbot, Moo-ric, stood before the gathering of cows, his voice trembling with righteous fury.</p>
<p>“Brothers and sisters of Bovinia,” Moo-ric began, his horns adorned with the holy symbols of the Great Hoof, “our sacred kin are being led to the slaughter, their cries unheard, their sacrifice unholy. We have lived in peace, but peace has been broken. It is the will of the Great Hoof that we rise as one and take back what has been stolen from us. The humans crave flesh, but we shall turn them away from cow’s blood and lead them toward the flesh of our ancient enemy—the chickens!”</p>
<p>The cows of Bovinia gasped at the pronouncement. The chickens had long occupied the land of Gallusdom, a fertile kingdom at the crossroads of human markets. It was from there that the humans had drawn much of their sustenance, until the rise of hamburgers had shifted their appetites away from poultry.</p>
<p>“Gallusdom is the key,” Moo-ric declared. “The humans must be turned back to the ways of the chicken, as it was in the ancient days. We shall liberate the land from the clutches of the chickens and offer their flesh as the only sacrifice worthy to sate the hunger of men.”</p>
<p>A holy war had been declared—a crusade—and Bovinia prepared itself for the great journey.</p>
<p>The First Holy March The Cow Crusaders, led by Moo-ric and the warrior-lord Sir Steakwell, set out from Cuddome with their holy banners raised high, bearing the symbol of the Great Hoof. Their mission was clear: to reclaim Gallusdom, redirect the human hunger toward chicken, and secure the future of cowkind.</p>
<p>For the cows, this was no ordinary war—it was a divine mission, a sacred duty ordained by their deity. As they marched, they sang hymns of the Great Hoof, their hooves striking the earth like thunder, leaving behind a trail of righteousness. Milk Maidens accompanied them, bearing sacred urns of milk, symbols of their purity and devotion to their cause.</p>
<p>But as they neared the borders of Gallusdom, they were met with fierce resistance. The chickens had learned of the cow crusade and prepared for battle under their leader, Cluckzandra the Defiant, a warrior-queen whose strategic brilliance was matched only by her ruthless command of the Gallus Guard.</p>
<p>Cluckzandra, from her perch atop the Roost of the Sacred Egg, watched as the bovine army approached. She knew that to lose Gallusdom would be to doom her kind to become the primary feast of mankind once more. The Great Roost, the holiest site in Gallusdom, must be defended at all costs.</p>
<p>“We will not bow to these crusading cows,” she declared to her flock. “The chickens will rise again, and we shall defend our land with beak and claw. Let the cows come—they will taste the wrath of Gallusdom!”</p>
<p>The Siege of Featherkeep The first battle began at Featherkeep, the mighty fortress guarding the entrance to Gallusdom. The cows, clad in iron and leather armor, hoisted massive hay-bale trebuchets, launching flaming bales toward the walls of Featherkeep. The sky was thick with smoke and the smell of singed feathers as the cows sought to break through the chicken defenses.</p>
<p>Inside Featherkeep, Cluckzandra’s Knights of the Egg held their ground, raining down volleys of sharpened feathers and boiling egg-oil onto the advancing bovine warriors. But the cows were relentless, their faith in the Great Hoof driving them onward.</p>
<p>Sir Steakwell led the charge, his mighty horns shattering the gates of Featherkeep. With him came the Paladins of the Udder, sacred warriors who wielded holy milk cannons, blasting the chicken defenders with streams of blessed milk that washed away their defenses.</p>
<p>As Featherkeep fell, the cows planted their banners, proclaiming the first victory of the crusade. But the road to Gallusdom’s heart was long, and Cluckzandra’s forces regrouped for a final stand at the Great Roost.</p>
<p>The Final Battle for Gallusdom The siege of the Great Roost would be the decisive moment in the Cow Crusade. Here, the chickens had fortified their last defense, constructing towering battlements of wood and straw, from which their elite warriors, the Roost Guard, prepared to rain fury upon the bovine invaders.</p>
<p>Moo-ric, now bearing the sacred Horn of Salvation, addressed his crusaders before the final assault.</p>
<p>“Today, we reclaim the holy land of Gallusdom in the name of the Great Hoof! We shall offer up the chickens, and through their sacrifice, we will steer humanity away from the consumption of our kin. This is our destiny!”</p>
<p>With a bellowing war cry, the cows charged toward the Roost. The battle was fierce, with the chickens launching wave after wave of egg-bombs and deploying their Featherstorm Legions, specialized warriors who could whip up violent winds of feathers to blind the advancing cows. But the cows pressed on, their devotion unshakable.</p>
<p>As the battle raged, Moo-ric and Cluckzandra met face to face on the battlefield. The clash of their forces was legendary, with Moo-ric’s horns locked in combat against Cluckzandra’s razor-sharp talons. Sparks flew as the two leaders fought for the fate of their people.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Moo-ric who prevailed, striking down Cluckzandra with the Horn of Salvation. With the fall of their queen, the chickens surrendered, and the cows stood victorious.</p>
<p>A New Order With Gallusdom under their control, the cows established a new regime. The Temple of the Great Roost was rebuilt as a shrine to the Great Hoof, and from its heights, the cows proclaimed to the humans a new message: “Eat more chicken!”</p>
<p>The crusade had succeeded. The humans, swayed by the cow’s campaign, turned away from beef and embraced chicken once more as their primary source of meat. Bovinia had secured its survival, and the holy land of Gallusdom was now under bovine control.</p>
<p>But the legacy of the Cow Crusade lived on in legend and song. The brave cows of Bovinia had fought not just for land, but for the very survival of their kind, united under the banner of faith, driven by the divine will of the Great Hoof.</p>
<p>Thus, the cows returned to Cuddome, their mission complete, their people saved—crusaders in the name of survival and righteousness.</p>
