**Base Tower (**BaseTower.cs**)**

This class forms the backbone of the tower system, defining the essential properties and methods used by all towers.

c#



public partial class BaseTower : Node2D { // Core Properties public float ShootingInterval { get; protected set; } public float RotationSpeed { get; protected set; } public int BulletsPerShot { get; protected set; } public float BulletSpeed { get; protected set; } public int BulletDamage { get; protected set; } } 

**Important Methods:**

1. OnBodyEntered(Area2D area)
   1. Triggered when an enemy enters the tower's range.
   1. Confirms if the target is valid and sets it as the current target.
1. FireBullets()
   1. Utilizes the builder pattern to construct bullets.
   1. Configures bullet properties and initiates the firing sequence.

**Design Patterns**

**1. Builder Pattern**

Implemented to construct diverse bullet types, accommodating varying tactical needs within the game.

c#



public interface IBulletBuilder { void CreateBullet(PackedScene bulletScene); void SetSpeed(float speed); void SetDamage(int damage); 

c#



void SetProperties(Vector2 position, Vector2 direction); Bullet GetResult(); } 

Implementations for diverse bullet types:

1. StandardBulletBuilder: Constructs standard bullets for regular use.
1. RapidBulletBuilder: Creates faster bullets for rapid-fire towers.
1. HeavyBulletBuilder: Develops high-damage bullets for heavy-duty towers.

**2. Factory Pattern**

Centralizes tower creation to manage instantiation and configuration seamlessly.

c#



public abstract class TowerFactory { protected PackedScene towerScene; public virtual BaseTower CreateTower(); } 

Implementations:

1. Create specific factory classes for each tower type that encapsulate the creation logic and initial configuration.

**Scene Structure**

**Tower Scene Components**

Details the organizational structure of a typical tower scene in Godot.

1. **Root Node (**Node2D**)**:
   1. Contains script linking to specific tower type logic.
   1. Export parameters for configuring the bullet type and tower components.
1. **Sprites**:
   1. **Towerbody (AnimatedSprite2D)**: Displays the main body of the tower.
   1. **Towerhead (AnimatedSprite2D)**: Visualizes the part of the tower that rotates and aims.
   1. **Cow indicator (Sprite2D)**: A simple visual indicator used for debugging or thematic elements.
1. **Collision Areas**:
   1. **Sight (Area2D)**: Defines the detection zone for enemy targets.
   1. **Placement (Area2D)**: Manages valid placement zones to ensure towers are positioned logically.
1. **Timer**:
   1. Manages the shooting intervals, ensuring towers fire at consistent rates according to their specifications.

**Bullet Scene Structure**

Describes how bullet components are structured within the game.

1. **Root Node (**Area2D**)**:
   1. Assigned to the "Projectile" group for collision and interaction purposes.
